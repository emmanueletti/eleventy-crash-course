# 11ty Crash Course

Learning from [this resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzM5lETc6Sg&list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW)

## Notes

- seems that the overall structure is
- src: holds the content
- \_includes: holds the structure
- \_includes/layouts: holds the large re-useable skeletons
- \_includes/partials: (made up by me) can hold re-useable molecules that can fill into the layouts
