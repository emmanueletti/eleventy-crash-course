# 11ty Crash Course

Seems the [this](https://dev.to/psypher1/lets-learn-11ty-part-1-installation-setup-3c0) is the better resource
- expect for the info on shortcodes 
- I prefer the shortcode components technique from the below youtube playlist

Alternative learning [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzM5lETc6Sg&list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW
- really like the shortcode components technique)

## Notes

- seems that the overall structure is
- src: holds the content
- \_includes: holds the structure
- \_includes/layouts: holds the large re-useable skeletons
- \_includes/partials: (made up by me) can hold re-useable molecules that can fill into the layouts

### Where I stopped

- [creating a blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2maHivd3pvA&list=PLtLXFsdHI8JTwScHvB924dY3PNwNJjjuW&index=5)
